I'm a 1st year PhD Student at the [Carnegie Mellon](https://www.cmu.edu/) [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://hcii.cmu.edu/), advised by Professor [Jeffrey Bigham](http://jeffreybigham.com).

Before I joined CMU, I graduated from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://gatech.edu/) in 2018 with a B.S. in Computer Science. There, I worked at the [GT Ubicomp Lab](http://ubicomp.cc.gatech.edu/).

My mission is to construct natural and expressive computer interfaces that intelligently assist all users, regardless of background or disability, in both the digital and physical worlds.

To achieve this, I teach computers to **listen**, **understand**, and **respond** to users by creating novel input interactions, mobile health sensing systems, accessible computing devices, and natural language interfaces.
